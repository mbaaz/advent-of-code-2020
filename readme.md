#Advent of Code - My Solutions#

## Info ##

These are my solutions to the problems defined at [https://adventofcode.com/2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

For the sake of the competition involved, I will push my solutions a few days after the task has been presented. 


## SETUP ##

### SessionID ###

To make the solution run, you will need to have a SessionID-variable set. 

The SessionID refers to the ID you get from logging in to [https://adventofcode.com/2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). This can be found inside the cookie named `SessionID` once you are logged in. Use your favorite method to read the cookie value from the browser. The reason for this is that the input files (and calculated answers) are user-specific and not the same for everyone.

Best method is to add a `User Secret` named `Settings:SessionID`, but if you are just testing offline go ahead and set the variable in Settings/appsettings.json.
